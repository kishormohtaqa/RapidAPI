# RapidAPI

This is an Weather API test automation project, which is build upon java and rest-assured. I have also used testng for running the test and maven for the build prupose and to store all the dependecies which are required.

So this project is validating 5scenarios which can be easily undersatandbale by description.

For running this project either you can easily run via textng.xml file 
                            Or
You can navigate to test folder--> java---> WeatherAPI---> TestCases --> run it simply it will run all the text cases written under this class.
